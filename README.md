# Virtual-Memory-Paging

In this Opearting Systems course project I wrote a program which simulates the workflow of 
reading/writing from/into virtual memory and reading/writing from the corresponding frame and physical adresss. 
The VM operations call a DFS-like algorithm which traverse a tree - the Hierarchy Page Table to find the corresponding frame and perform the read/write operations.
